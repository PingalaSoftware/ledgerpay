                    (6) Other measures: We regularly review our personal data
                    collection, storage and processing procedures; furthermore,
                    we limit the access of our employees and suppliers to Your
                    data in accordance with the principle of “as necessary”, and
                    our employees and suppliers must abide by strict contractual
                    confidentiality obligations.
                </div>

                    2. If You become aware of any security vulnerability of our
                    Platform, please contact us promptly so that We can adopt
                    appropriate actions as soon as possible.

                    3. Despite the above-mentioned technical and security
                    measures, We cannot guarantee the absolute safety of data
                    transmission on the Internet, so We cannot absolutely
                    guarantee that the personal data You provide to us through
                    our Platform are safe at all times. We will not regularly
                    update and make public security risks and personal
                    information security impact assessment reports, inter alia,
                    which You can obtain through announcements made by this
                    Platform.

                <div>V. How You manage Your information</div>

                    You have the right to obtain a copy of Your personal data
                    upon Your request, and to determine whether the information
                    we have about You is accurate and up-to-date. If any of Your

                    Your information. You can also request for the deletion of
                    Your personal data, provided, however, we may reject Your
                    deletion request in some cases, e.g., where such rejection
                    is required by law or for other legal purposes. For data
                    access, correction or deletion requests, please contact us

                    deletion of data, we will verify the identity of the
                    applicant to ensure that such applicant is legally entitled
                    to make such application. Although our goal is to respond to
                    such application on a gratuitous basis, we reserve the right
                    to charge You a reasonable fee if Your request is repeated
                    or onerous.
                </div>
                <div>ii. Changing the scope of Your authorization</div>
                <div>

                    When You withdraw Your consent, We will no longer process
                    the corresponding personal information. However, Your
                    decision to withdraw Your consent will not affect the
                    existing personal information processing based on Your
                    authorization.
                </div>
                <div>iii. Cancellation of Your account</div>

                    stop providing You with products or services, and delete
                    Your personal information or anonymize it in accordance with
                    the requirements of applicable laws.

                <div>iv. Respond to Your above requests</div>
                <div>
                    To ensure safety, You may need to provide a written request
                    or prove Your identity in other ways. We may ask You to
                    verify Your identity before processing Your request.
                </div>
                <div>
                    We will reply within fifteen(15) days. If You are not

                <div>
                    In principle, We do not charge any fee on Your reasonable
                    requests, provided, however, We may charge a certain fee on
                    Your repeated requests or requests that exceed reasonable
                    limits, based on the actual circumstances. We may reject
                    requests involving information that is not directly related
                    to Your identity, unjustified repeated information, or
                    requests that require too many technical means (e.g. to
                    develop new systems or fundamentally change existing
                    practices), requests that pose risks to any other person's
                    legitimate rights and interests, or are unrealistic.
